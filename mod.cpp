It was released mid 2012 as a standalone game using the Real Virtuality 3 engine also powering Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead. <br /><br />Our development team has ported the assets to Arma 3 to be used in the latest RV engine. This most recent version supports many of the new technologies and features of Arma 3 and is continued to be made more complete.";
